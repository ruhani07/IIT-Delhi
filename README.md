# IIT-DEHLI
As part of my research at IIT Delhi, I conducted a comparative analysis of two prominent object detection algorithms: Viola-Jones and Faster R-CNN. For this project, I utilized the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, a well-regarded benchmark in object detection tasks.

The PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset consists of 9,963 images annotated with 24,640 objects across 20 diverse classes. These classes include various categories such as:

Person: person
Animal: bird, cat, cow, dog, horse, sheep
Vehicle: aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bus, car, motorbike, train
Indoor: bottle, chair, dining table, potted plant, sofa, tv/monitor
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test subsets, providing a comprehensive foundation for evaluating object detection methods.

Key Findings:

Viola-Jones Algorithm: Demonstrated strong performance in face detection but proved less effective for general object detection tasks. Its limitations become apparent when applied to a broader range of object categories.
Faster R-CNN: Exhibited superior performance in object detection across various categories, showcasing its capability to handle diverse and complex object recognition challenges.
This project highlighted the strengths and limitations of both algorithms, contributing valuable insights into their applicability for different object detection scenarios.
